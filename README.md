- Modification of [neuraltalk2](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2)

# Features
- In our experiments, we got reached at CIDEr 0.8 with our BN-inception7 net(vgg16 baseline: 0.65~0.68). We trained LSTM at first, and then finetuned CNN as well(we got about 0.02 points improvement). 
We look forward to the updated result(higer than 0.9) from Karpathy. We are very curious how to got reached at that result.
